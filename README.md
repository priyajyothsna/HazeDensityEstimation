HazDesNet - Haze Density Estimation

HazDesNet is a deep learning model designed for estimating haze density in images. It uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict haze levels and visualize the results. This project includes a trained model and a simple GUI for user-friendly analysis.
#Features
Uses Keras for deep learning model implementation
